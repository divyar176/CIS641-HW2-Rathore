* Hello! I am a computer science graduate student currently in the second semester. I am looking forward to diving deep into programming.
* I have a strong inclination towards web development and cloud computing. My passion for software lies with thinking up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces.
* Some technologies I enjoy working with include javascript, HTML, CSS, Java, Azure cloud.

# Technical Background:
I am an Experienced Database Engineer with 3+ years of IT experience as a database administrator. I have Worked on Azure DevOps, Power BI reporting with Microsoft as my client. I am currently working as a graduate assistant with the faculty of computing wherein I am responsible to create a schedule visualization tool software which helps the faculty to keep a check on all the existing clases and lab sessions assigned to them.
 
# Project Description:
We are currently working on building a web application which is for small-scale business units. This web application focuses on hiring employees and we strongly believe that this can be of optimal use for employers who don't have a dedicated website to post their job openings. It is different from the other job portal website because we have a lot of websites that enlist the companies/business unit which is well established but not the ones which are currently formed and are in an initial stage of their business.
